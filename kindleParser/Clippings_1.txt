It is a difficult but challenging time and, therefore, you would do well to remember, no matter how your personal circumstances may otherwise appear, that you have chosen to be here.

In the deep inner world of Gaia, there lives a bustling, thriving civilization of highly evolved beings—descendants of the first Atlantean colonizers of the underground. Protected from the geophysical disturbance and upheaval that has swept your surface world for so many millions of years, the Atlanteans not only survived the last great Ice Age, but went on to create a superb world in the womb of the Earth Mother … a land of the yin vibration. A land known as Agharta.

In your quest to understand the enormity of All That Is—your desire to find your place as human beings in the multidimensional Universe—remember that life knows no limits. Consciousness cannot be classified to meet a finite set of criteria in which it can exist, for the designer, Prime Creator, is “in-finite.”

You do exit from the material reality constantly, although you are rarely aware of it. At any moment of your waking or sleeping experience, you may slip into parallel worlds in which you also exist and with which you hold resonance—for whatever experience your soul requires.

Dear Ones, of you we know with certainty one undeniable truth: You came into your current 3D reality to serve as the catalysts of change that will help calm the fury and bring the inner sanctuaries and surface lands of Gaia back to center.

Intent is life. It is eternal transformation and eternal interaction. Intent is what we call God. Intent is life by itself; it is God and it is Spirit.

In order to know if a thought is "of God," we can check to see if it creates fear. A fearful thought is not from God, although it may come from an Ally. The true God of love has nothing to do with fear.

Each nation has its own god. The destiny of humanity is the story of these gods. Jehovah is the god of one nation. Allah is the god of another. The identities of the gods are as real as the Israelis and the Arabs. When war comes, it is not just a war among people. It is literally a war of the gods as well.

To achieve happiness, you need to express who you really are, not the person other people expect you to be. Through a process of self-scrutiny, you can discover who you were before you were domesticated. Then you can recover the freedom to use your own mind, your own body, your own brain to express yourself outside the dream which is life.

I grew up as one of the geeky kids who didn't fit in. I was too smart, too socially awkward, and had too many unusual hobbies to be a typical kid.

When a couple becomes enmeshed, that is, when the individualities of each partner are sacrificed to the relationship, the individuals and the partnership suffer. Sometimes, as in Carla’s case, one partner forces the other to give up separate opinions, perspectives, and preferences. Sometimes, as Donna described, a partner takes on her mate’s views and ideas voluntarily.
…
At first this might feel good to both partners. She’d feel stronger now that she had some ideas she hadn’t had before. He’d feel very important that he could give her these things and that she liked them enough to take them on—very flattering. What would happen later, though, when she disagreed with him? It would upset the balance of the marriage. She’d be changing a pattern that had been established. He might feel she was attacking his way of thinking.

 Obviously, too much distance in a relationship leads to a cooling of romantic interest. Surprisingly, enmeshment can do the same. Here’s why. Enmeshment, remember, may feel close, but it isn’t. Enmeshment means someone’s individuality is being squashed. An enmeshed person is not known.
