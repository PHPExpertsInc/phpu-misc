For the most part, the disorder is hidden and doesn't surface until emotional intimacy triggers it. So until we come into their lives, it doesn't show itself.

I've found it helpful to use what I call the Quick Test for a BPD. It has three questions: 
    a. Does this person rage and punish? 
    b. Does this person withdraw love and/or attention when they don't get what they want? Or when they feel like you're getting “too close” to them?
    c. Does this person have empathy/compassion?

=====
Another way to detect lack of empathy and compassion is to apply what I call the Have a Heart Test. You know there's an impaired ability to feel empathy for others when you find yourself frequently saying things to this person like, “Lighten up. He's only a small child,” or “Have some patience. She didn't mean any harm,” or “How can you be so upset at him? He's hard of hearing!” 

These three questions of the Quick Test frequently reveal tip of the iceberg behavior which indicates the possibility of serious pain coming our way from that person if we continue the relationship.

BPDs have serious emotional problems, and we do feel sorry for them. However, we have been trained and programmed since early childhood to be manipulated by rage and withdrawal. 

So we need protection – from them and from ourselves! 

We need an <em>invisible shield</em> (a <em>Wacko Protector</em>, as my friend calls it) to shelter us until we're clear that the new person in our life is safe to trust and give our hearts to – a tool kit in our pocket would be nice, something we whip out like a Star Wars light saber the minute we sense danger. 

Unless we keep the <em>Quick Test</em> questions firmly in our minds as we move through life relating to people, we're almost doomed to continue getting ensnared in the quicksand of BPD-ism over and over again.

Certainly, being in a relationship with a BPD is a <em>colossal disaster</em> – emotionally, physically, mentally, psychologically, spiritually and many times financially. Wouldn't it be nice to be <em>BPD resistant</em>? – to not be affected by BPD behavior – or even (do we dare even wish) to never again be in a relationship with a BPD?

As with <em>disaster preparedness</em>, with <em>BPD preparedness</em>, we would study all the possible ways BPD <em>disaster</em> could strike us – rage, love withdrawal, projection, blame, black and white thinking, splitting and devaluation, jealousy and possessiveness, envy, fear of abandonment, fear of emotional intimacy, etc. And <em>my</em> personal favorite – behavior that leaves us feeling like we've been thrown in the trash can. 

When we know the ways <em>our personal</em> BPD might strike out at us, and we've still decided we want to remain in the relationship, we can plan our responses.

Have I confused courage with wisdom? 

I've certainly been more optimistic about outcomes than many of my friends. Co-Dependents Anonymous says some of us “stay in harmful jobs and relationships far too long.” For me, I can only see “far too long” looking backwards. Looking forward is more complicated.

“… the Narcissist affects his victims by infiltrating their psyche, by penetrating their defenses. Like a virus, it establishes a new strain within his/her victims. It echoes through them, it talks through them, it walks through them. It is like the invasion of the body snatchers. 

“You should be careful to separate your ‘selves’ from the narcissist inside you, this alien growth, this spiritual cancer that is the result of living with a narcissist. You should be able to tell apart your real you and the ‘you’ assigned to you by the narcissist. 

“To cope with him/her, the narcissist forces you to ‘walk on eggshells’ and develop a false self of your own. It is nothing as elaborate as his/her False Self, but it is there, in you, as a result of the trauma and abuse inflicted upon you by the narcissist.”

Walking on eggshells, we understand that. Smiling when we're crying inside, hoping not to set off another round of <em>zero to psycho</em> rage – avoiding talking about any topic that might trigger another <em>nuking</em> our way. 

When our antennae pick up <em>any possibility</em> of hurt coming our way, how quickly we can put our <em>own</em> masks on. Yet the BPD-caused damage goes into our psyche anyway, doesn't it? Somehow, the words and the intensity of their emotions when we're split and devalued penetrate the walls we try to put up. 

A spiritual cancer does indeed begin to grow inside us. The malignancy (malignancies kill, you know) tells us we are what the BPD says we are (even though intellectually, in our heads, we know it's not true).

I wonder if … all of us in relationships with BPDs … need to realistically accept that we will always live under the knife – just a few steps away from traumatic pain over which we have no control. 

All control is really in the hands of the BPD partner. Try as we might, we can't see inside their heads to know what's <em>really</em> going on there, to protect ourselves in advance of their actions.

my BPD was doing <em>physical harm</em>, the abuse would be obvious. But if we're <em>emotionally</em> abused, then first we have to explain it to them and why it's wrong. There is something insidious about being hurt and having to explain <em>why</em> we hurt, because someone else's view of reality is so distorted.

Personality disorders are like one-armed bandits in a casino. We keep putting money in, expecting a pay-out. The machine flashes its lights, states the current jackpot and generally looks like a payment is coming. We may get small payments, but we never get the jackpot. The purpose of the flashing lights and small payouts is to ensure that we keep putting our coins in.

She has split images of you, based on whether or not her needs are getting met the way she wants them. Whatever you are willing to put up with is exactly what you will have. When you live with a BPD, every day is Groundhog Day. We live the same conflicts over and over, just inserting a new trigger issue every so often to give the illusion of variety. I'm finally in a place where I understand that she <em>has</em> to rage, and she <em>deserves</em> to rage. I just won't <em>engage</em> her in her rage any more.

How do we describe to others the <em>never knowing</em> from one minute to the next whether they'll explode at us? How can we tell people how nervous we feel when it gets <em>quiet</em>?

These individuals can empathize with and nurture other people, but only with the expectation that the other person will “be there” in return to meet their own needs on demand. These individuals are prone to sudden and dramatic shifts in their view of others, who may alternately be seen as beneficent supports or as cruelly punitive.

Individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder may have a pattern of undermining themselves at the moment a goal is about to be realized (e.g., dropping out of school just before graduation; regressing severely after a discussion of how well therapy is going; destroying a good relationship just when it is clear that the relationship could last).… Individuals with this disorder may feel more secure with transitional objects (i.e., a pet or inanimate possession) than in interpersonal relationships.… Recurrent job losses, interrupted education, and broken marriages are common. Physical and sexual abuse, neglect, hostile conflict, and early parental loss or separation are more common in the childhood histories of those with borderline personality disorder.
