The fragment of soul consciousness that separates (just as you, a spark of light, have separated from Source) is free to connect with any level of awareness or conscious being with which it finds resonance. It can break away, move into the light, experience “death” from that limited perspective, and return in a completely different embodiment, creating a rather complex state of being, which we ask you to consider as “parallel lives” within the lifetime.

The common experience of all evolved civilizations in the light realms of the multidimensional Universe is the understanding of sound as the weaver of all frequencies. It is thought, crystallizing to a slower frequency at select points of time and space, and then creating a lattice, or pattern, that moves all souls forward, upon the Great Spiral

you have to completely detach from what you believe you are; you have to let go of the story of your life. It’s just like the moment right before your brain goes to sleep — when you are so tired that you cannot keep your eyes open any longer. In that moment, you detach from everything; you don’t care about anything in your story because you just want to sleep. When you can do this without falling asleep, you will have the experience again.”

With the collapse of the empire and breakup of the Soviet Union, Russia seems to have lost the will to live. In an historic development, Russia’s population has fallen from 148 million in 1991 to 140 million today and is projected to plunge to 116 million by 2050, a loss of 32 million Russians in six decades.61 If these projections hold, six decades of freedom will have resulted in the disappearance of more Russians than seventy years of Bolshevism, from the October Revolution through the civil war of 1919–1920, to the starvation of the Kulaks, the Great Terror of the 1930s, the gulag, and all the dead of the Great Patriotic War with Nazi Germany from 1941 to 1945.

In diverse communities, people not only do not trust strangers, they do not trust their own kind. They withdraw into themselves, they support community activity less, they vote less. “People living in ethnically diverse settings,” said Putnam, “appear to ‘hunker down,’ that is, to pull in like a turtle.”94

A study of charity by Notre Dame economist Daniel Hungerman “found that all-white congregations became less charitably active as the share of black residents in the local community grows.” A study by Alesina, Reza Baqir of the IMF, and William Easterly of New York University found that municipal spending—on roads, sewage, education, and trash clearance—is smaller in racially diverse cities. A 2003 study by Julian Betts and Robert Fairlie of the University of California “found that for every four immigrants who arrived in public high schools, one native student switched to a private school.”101

Yet America is on track to add 130 million people in four decades, mostly Third World immigrants and their children. Every U.S. city will resemble Los Angeles today. And Putnam found Los Angeles to be the textbook case of a multiracial, multiethnic, multilingual stew in which the levels of suspicion and distrust were higher than he had ever measured anywhere before.

There are today just eight states on earth which both existed in 1914 and have not had their form of government changed by violence since then. These are the United Kingdom, four present or former members of the Commonwealth, the United States, Sweden and Switzerland. Of the remaining 170 or so contemporary states, some are too recently created to have known much recent turmoil, but for the greater number that have gone, by far the most frequent factor involved has been ethnic conflict.9

[E]thnonationalism has played a more profound role in modern history than is commonly understood, and the processes that led to the dominance of the ethnonational state and the separation of ethnic groups in Europe are likely to reoccur elsewhere. In areas where that separation has not yet occurred, politics is apt to remain ugly.8

These attributes of an application—robustness, dependability, modifiability, and so on—are reliable indicators of application quality that go beyond the defects identified during testing or the process inefficiencies or compliance lapses indentified in quality assurance. Therefore, the quality of an application can and must be defined in such a way as to accommodate these indicators of quality that outrun those identified in testing and quality assurance.

God is the Source of all that is creative. Answers are not creative. As soon as you think you have an answer, you stop creating. Answers kill creation. The last thing you want is the final answer to anything. A “possible answer,” maybe. An “interim answer,” perhaps. But a “final answer”? Never. Ultimately, there is only one question in life. That question is, “Who am I?” It is a question to which you never want a final answer. Stay within the question. Remain always with the inquiry. For within the inquiry is the power and the motivation and the passion to create. And creation is the glory of God, made manifest over and over again in ever new and never-final

And one day Siddhartha Gautama said, “I am going to sit beneath this tree until I am enlightened. I’ve tried everything. I’ve done all the physical disciplines, all the trainings, all the exercise, all the starvation, all the diets, all the fasting, and all the meditation. I’m just going to sit here on the ground, I’m tired of all this stuff, and I’m not getting up until I’m enlightened.” And there he sat, doing nothing. No exercises, no meditations, no fasting, no nothing, just sitting there doing absolutely nothing. Now that is hard for many of us to do, because we think there is something we are supposed to be doing in order to be enlightened. The Buddha sat there until he opened his eyes and realized that he was enlightened. And he said, “I’m enlightened.” And people came to him and cried out, “What did you do? What did you do? Teach us, master! You have become the Buddha, the enlightened one. What is the secret? What did you do?” And the Buddha said something quite extraordinary. “There is nothing that you have to do.”

Now, when you have so much happiness, peace, wisdom, and joy that you spend your life sharing it with everyone else, no matter what your predicament, that’s enlightenment. You have become a master. When your life is no longer about you, has nothing to do with you, but is about everyone else whose life you touch, you have become a master. In the end, that is why you came here. You did not come here to somehow “get better,” or to “work on your stuff.” Consider the possibility that all the work you will ever need to do is finished. All you have to do now is know that.

But for large systems and large applications, coding defects are not the main source of trouble. Coding defects are also the easiest to eliminate. For large systems, requirements defects, architectural defects, and design defects are the main sources of quality problems. Of course, large databases and large websites have serious quality problems, too.

The majority of defects that cause system outages, performance degradation, security breaches, and exorbitant maintenance costs are no longer isolated in a single file or piece of code (Hamill, 2009). The most catastrophic problems occur in interactions among the various tiers of an application. Even more challenging, these defects are not failures to satisfy the functional requirements provided by the customer but rather are nonfunctional defects in the engineering of the application’s architecture or source code (Spinellis, 2007).

One of the traditional definitions of software quality for more than 50 years has been “conformance to requirements.” This is an unfortunate definition, however, because requirements themselves are filled with defects that generate about 20% of the total volume of software defects. The current U.S. average for requirements defects is about 1.00 per function point. It is obvious that conformance to a major source of error is not a safe definition for software quality.

When analyzing the features of IBM’s commercial software packages, it was discovered that almost 10% of the features in the deployed applications were not in the requirements at all! What was happening was that the IBM developers were spontaneously adding new features that seemed useful to them, even though the features were not in the original requirements. This same phenomenon has since been observed in many other companies. Indeed, some companies such as Google actually encourage the practice. In general, these developer-originated features are benign, and some are valuable.

software requirements changes tend to have a higher defect potential than original requirements (due to rushing them) and a lower defect removal efficiency rate (due to skimping on quality control). Therefore, requirements changes contribute more than their fair share to overall defects in software applications. A 10% growth in application size due to changing requirements will result in about a 12% increase in delivered defects.

Inspections are not only one of the top-ranked methods of defect removal, but they are surprisingly one of the top-ranked methods of defect prevention. The reason that inspections are so effective as a defect prevention method is that the participants in inspections will spontaneously avoid making the same kinds of defects that the inspections discover. Thus, within about a year of deploying inspections, defect potentials tend to drop by about 50% for all deliverables that were inspected.

Do not tolerate abusive treatment such as tantrums, threats, hitting and spitting. There is a range of ways to set limits on them. A mild gesture would be to walk out of the room to avoid rewarding the tantrum with attention.

Describe the situation as you see it in a factual, unemotional manner. “You call me more than a dozen times at work each day. It distracts me and makes it hard to focus. I share an office, so other people can hear, and I’m not supposed to take personal calls at work.” Express your feelings or opinions about the situation clearly. “I am feeling really frustrated because I’ve told you before that this can’t continue. When I am at work, I have to stay on task.”

Don’t Ask Permission or Overexplain What you don’t say is just as important as what you do say. If, after previous discussions, you felt as though you had been agitated through a washing machine, unsure about why things got off track, you probably made the mistake of asking permission to set the limit instead of stating your expectations. This is by far the most common mistake that people make.

To avoid being pulled into an argument about your limits, you must let go of your compelling need to make your family member agree with you. Don’t overexplain or defend. To that end, minimize the word because, especially if it seems as though your family member is likely asking questions so she can refute or poke holes into any explanation you give. Don’t get pulled off topic.

Most people believe that remaining calm in the face of strong emotions expressed by their BP loved one is the best and most effective course of action, but in reality, it is not. A study of BPD patients using functional MRI technology "found that the level of amygdala activation to the Fearful, and Neutral faces in BPD patients is significantly correlated with diagnostic measures of emotional lability."28 What does that mean to you? Well, although clothed in scientific language, what that means is that a person with BPD is more likely to view a "neutral" (or calm) face as a threat and become fearful. If you go "calm" on her, in the face of her emotional dysregulation, she will see you as a threat and, if she sees you as a threat, she will do one of two things: fight or flee.

Therefore, if you respond to an emotional communication in either an invalidating fashion (using one of the many, many invalidating phrases above) or in a way that doesn't match the emotional distress, the BP will feel unable to communicate. She will think "I'm going off the deep end here and you are so calm! You don't understand anything! You'll never understand me!", and not trust you.

When you are being attacked it is natural to defend yourself. This is especially true when the attack has no basis in reality, when the attack is based entirely on the feelings of the BP. I'm sure that you have experienced this kind of attack before. BP's are famous for coming up with "crazy" notions and attributing them to you.

People with toxic and core shame often exhibit "push-pull" behavior in which you, as a partner or parent, are loved and cherished one day and hated and reviled the next. She may run from a relationship if you get too close. She wants to be able the control the inevitable ending of the relationship. In her mind, which has a sense of "background shame," she expects that one day you will see through her and discover that she is a bad person, judge her as unworthy of love and leave. This dynamic gives rise to the fear of abandonment and sensitivity to judgment.

A BP's brain is working against them by upsetting the emotional regulation system. It is impossible for a BP not to feel those emotions. The emotions are not right or wrong, they just are. It is the behaviors that arise from the emotions that can be changed, and that is where we will focus our attention.

One of the things that you will need to accept about your loved one is that she has a serious mental illness and that she may never be completely normal. It is perfectly natural to grieve for the "normal" child or "normal" relationship that you may never attain – so go ahead cry and mourn if you feel sad. After the grieving, acceptance should make it easier. This is not to say there is no hope – little-by-little things can get better, but the choice to make things better is sometimes not completely yours.

Abstraction  from past experiences being mistaken for current experience itself is  the major disorienting error of the normal garden-variety neurotic.  "I've been with you for 20 years-it should be obvious that I love you."  Evidence from the past doesn't prove anything about current experience.   We neurotics are people who make big generalizations to cover  long periods of time. We say things like, "You always..." and "You  never...." We attribute all of our power to circumstances and say  things like "It makes me...."

Our minds  work pretty much the same way our gastrointestinal systems work. A  mind is developed to take good nourishing truth, absorb what it can,  and turn the rest to shit.

The creator being is the being that came alive in the womb at about four  or five months after conception when the wiring was complete and the light  came on. We forget this being rather quickly. In just a few years we are so  surrounded by our creation, the sea of suggestions, we can hardly touch or  taste or smell or feel or see the ocean of experience that still surrounds us.  We forget we live in a sea that is a part of an ocean at all. We forget we are  the source of the whole ocean. Getting born again is remembering that.

we awaken in the womb into an ocean of experience.   Over a long period of time, that ocean of experience becomes a  sea of suggestions. We lose track of the ocean of experience. We lose  track of having created the sea. After we have lost track of everything sufficiently, we continue to  interact with the sea and create a self. What we call the "self" is a creation   of further interactions of the sea of suggestions. The being we  were when we began, the being we actually still are, alive in an ocean of  experience, including all the ocean as itself, recedes to the background  of our attention, and the "self" we have created comes to the foreground.   As we identify with our newly created self, we lose touch with  the being we are and have been since the light came on.

The sentimental, idealistic romanticism   of deeply felt religious belief, though responsible for the suffering  of millions, was relatively harmless until we developed hydrogen  bombs and other world-threatening technology. We can no longer  afford to sit around in groups together to indulge in a tearful remembering   forward, of a forgotten hoped-for sense of unity, at the direction  of various priests and patrolmen who would have us gear up to attack  other groups doing the same thing.

Because of the various doomsday scenarios for the fate of the  earth, we must make a sudden advance in consciousness or perish.  Unless more human beings expand who they consider themselves to  be, by re-including what they excluded when they grew a personality   unless more of us grow beyond the ignorant provincialism of adolescent   moralizing - the game is over. Like rats behind the Pied Piper, we  will follow our leaders off the cliff and back into the sea forever.

They constantly warn their children to be careful,  do this, don't do that, and watch out for a dangerous world. The results  for millions of us have been tragic. We have been taught to be paranoid  and guarded in life as our parents' way of trying to ensure our survival  after they are gone. In turn, we attempt to convince our own children of  the correctness of believing in the rules of safety, so that they will act  according to the principles we teach them. We teach them how to be  good according to our morals, then to believe in moralism, then to moralize.

The process of demythologizing yourself is begun by bragging  about all the things which, in your false modesty, you were pretending  you didn't care about. You have to go through your vanity and the suffering   associated with it. You have to show off and be embarrassed,  both of which are egotism, and you can't skip, dodge, or get around this  step. You have to praise yourself openly rather than manipulate to suck  praise. You have to acknowledge being a secret hero to yourself and  confess the putrid vanity of all of your usual phony self-denigration.  You have to admit what a worm and a liar you are and go through the  feelings that come up when you tell the truth about all of this.

Your Borderline will initially blow your mind. The experience will be better than any drug you can get. However, they ALWAYS break your spirit in the end. Your initial elation will become a sick and diabolical addiction. Your Borderline knows this only too well having spent a lifetime playing the game. He/she WILL pull the plug eventually.

When a relationship ends it is ALWAYS hard. But when a Borderline relationship ends, it’s harder… Why? Well, mainly because your Borderline “mirrored” your desires! He/she understood your hopes and long-term dreams, and gave them to you on a silver platter. Not only that but, allowed you to come back over-and-over again; until, of course, they got bored or more likely, saw your character flaws. This is a characteristic of Borderline love.

Did your Borderline emphasize to you that it were you that did the chasing? This is a safety mechanism designed to deflect blame. The one thing a Borderline detests more than anything else is being held accountable. Did it always seem to you that your Borderline somehow always had one foot outside of the relationship as you became more and more enmeshed? Once again, the fear of abandonment was the sole reason… This is primarily why when the relationship has finally ended, you suffer and your Borderline keeps on trucking oblivious.

If you think that your Borderline may soften at some point after the break-up, FORGET IT! Nor will their inability to take their share of the blame diminish. Any hope you may harbour of resolve, maybe an apology, some clarity regarding their true feelings for you, an admission of guilt, etc, will NOT be offered. In fact, getting closure from a Borderline is probably harder than coming back from the dead;

The truth is, real LOVE doesn’t just die after an argument or break-up. It took time for it to develop and takes time to fade. Learn from this. Understand your Borderline is incapable of feeling love because they don’t understand the concept. To them it is a word. By observing the behaviour of your ex Borderline in the immediate aftermath of the relationship demise, you will get a much fuller picture as to how they REALLY felt about you. But don’t, please, take it personally! Your Borderline DID at least admire you before you were blacked. Otherwise, and this is what many fail to comprehend, they would NOT have entertained you.

A common misconception is that Antisocial Personality Disorder refers to people who have poor social skills. The opposite is often the case. Instead, antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a lack of conscience. People with this disorder are prone to criminal behaviour, believing that their victims are weak and deserving of being taken advantage of.

Avoidant Personality Disorder is characterized by extreme social anxiety. People with this disorder often feel inadequate, avoid social situations, and seek out jobs with little contact with others. They are fearful of being rejected and worry about embarrassing themselves in front of others. They exaggerate the potential difficulties of new situations to rationalize avoiding them. Often, they will create fantasy worlds to substitute for the real one. Unlike schizoid personality disorder, avoidant people yearn for social relations yet feel they are unable to obtain them. They are frequently depressed and have low self-confidence.

Borderline ambivalence is typified by fears of suffocation  if another person gets too close, alternating with terror of abandonment if  he strays too far.

Because many borderlines are  convinced that the realization of their greatest fear--abandonment-is inevitable,   there is a kind of "hurry up and get it over with," waiting-for-the-other-shoe-to-drop   anticipation, which can be maddening. Thus the  borderline may aggressively probe for problems in the relationship. Such  challenges also seek insatiable reassurance that the relationship can  indeed be viable.

Needless to say, maintaining a relationship with someone with BPD  can be challenging. Understanding this "no win" paradox is essential.  Convincing the borderline that you are unconditionally accepting (since  virtually no one else in his life has been) is almost impossible. Demonstrations   will never be enough. So don't try. Giving advice, even or, particularly   -when solicited, is fraught with peril. In such situations it is  usually better to help him understand and accept that he may be frustrated  at anything you might say. You may he able to "walk him through" how he  might respond to any potential response:

Recent research has indicated that the moods associated with BPD do  not involve all emotions. Specifically, BPD is strongly associated with  greater lability of anger, anxiety, and severe oscillation from depression to  anxiety. Surprisingly, however, oscillation between depression and elation  does not correlate as significantly. The most discriminating emotion suggestive   of the 13PD diagnosis is anger lability, which predicts BPD versus  another personality disorder with 72 percent accuracy.

Later  theorists who emphasized object relations development (how the infant  relates to his environment, rather than how he responds to internal stimuli)   stressed that failures in early caretaking resulted in an inability to  internalize soothing feelings of safety and contentment. As an adult, the  individual is unable to evoke remembered images or feelings of soothing  and is unable to self-soothe, resulting in the subjective sensation of  emptiness.

to other expressions of anger, borderline rage is marked  by a suddenness and unpredictability that could be described as emotional   spontaneous combustion. Even though borderlines may seem to  explode for no ostensible reason, the anger is always present, lying hidden  under the surface, suppressed by the fear of abandonment, or turned  inward and transformed into self-destructive behavior.

Another investigation confirmed that rage and hostility were significantly   greater in borderline patients than in nonpatient participants in the  study. Further, there was a trend for anger to be less intense in those borderlines   who were depressed. This inverse relationship between hostility  and depression suggests that perhaps depression diminishes the experience   of anger in borderlines or possibly that expressed anger is a defense  against depression. In any event, this observation may be unique to borderlines,   since other studies of depressed psychiatric patients note that  increased depression is correlated with increased anger and violence.

For many borderlines, anger derives from frustration. Continuous disappointment   simmers undetected and eventually boils into a fury directed  blindly at a hostile world. Anger may be displayed prominently and in  many cases preemptively: "I know you're going to hurt and abandon me  soon, so hurry up and get it over with. Waiting for the inevitable is making   me so anxious, in fact, I'll hurry it along by being angry and spiteful,  just to speed up the process."

Anger also may he diluted when the borderline provokes abuse  to reenact old scenarios from the past, a phenomenon known as "repetition   compulsion." Psychoanalytic theory suggests that this behavior is an attempt to reconstruct past experiences with a more favorable outcome-that   is, "to get it right this time around." Such provocation also may allow  the borderline to feel more in control of the relationship by creating a situation   in which the partner loses his temper, becomes rageful, then  remorseful, finally begging for forgiveness from the victimized but now  empowered borderline.

The first instinct is to dispel the anger through logical argument. However,   for the borderline, overpowering anger is the "prime directive" (in  Star Tirekkie terms) and the underlying presumption is, to paraphrase the  Tina Turner classic, "What's logic got to do with it?" Regardless of the  surface issue, rational attempts to dispute the issue typically result in a  "damned if you do and damned if you don't" morass. In fact, the borderline   may even "switch sides" as the argument proceeds.

the borderline can erupt at any time with no apparent  rhyme or reason; the destruction, in an emotional sense, can be as swift  and rampant as a midwestern tornado. Yet strangely, after a while, the  borderline's anger can become remarkably predictable in its unpredictability.   Greg would start to brace himself against an explosion of  rage from Arleen after a tender moment (see chapter 2), for it was in  that moment that Arleen would become most afraid of Greg abandoning   or smothering her-equally terrifying prospects.

Detachment is a necessary and important balance to empathy.  Immersion in the cauldron of BPD emotions can be draining. Attempts to  totally satisfy all of the borderline's needs are doomed to fail and only  reinforce unrealistic expectations. Firm boundaries must be maintained.  The borderline will be disappointed and fling guilt at the therapist who  takes a vacation or the boyfriend who spends time with his other friends,  but such respite time is important for all parties. It is unhealthy for the  therapist or friend to sacrifice his own interests in response to borderline  demands; this will only fuel resentment, which, in turn, will threaten calm  and accepting consistency.

Because of the time or emotional commitment or complexity of the  process, many therapists try to avoid treating patients with a known  diagnosis of BPD. Unfortunately, since the correct diagnosis is often  missed or delayed, many practitioners, whether they like it or not,  become "stuck" with unwanted borderline patients, to the detriment of  both the patient and the therapist. In such situations, transfer of care may  best serve both parties.

I. Maintain boundaries. Lacking a consistent sense of identity, the borderline   easily merges with another. It is therefore necessary for both  parties to maintain their separateness, despite the temptation to become  twins of the soul, joined at their emotions, excluding the rest of the  world. Recognize and embrace differences. Encourage the borderline to  pursue his own distinct interests and talents.

if the feeling is particularly strong, or if the action you decide to take is radical, I suggest waiting a day or so, until you are peaceful and your mind is consistent. In other words: detach. Our feelings don’t need to control us. Just because we’re angry, we don’t have to scream and hit. Just because we’re sad or depressed, we don’t have to lie in bed all day.

We may be living with people now who are telling us directly or indirectly that we can’t think. Some of them may even be telling us we’re crazy, but alcoholics do that to people they live with. Maybe we’ve started wondering if we are crazy! But don’t believe any of it for one moment.

Quit saying bad things about our minds. Stop telling ourselves things like, “I’m stupid,” “I can’t make good decisions,” “I’m really not very smart,” “I’ve never been good at figuring things out,” or “I’m not very good at decisions.” It’s just as easy to say good things about ourselves as it is to say negative things. And, we’ll probably start believing the positive things and find out they’re true. Isn’t that exciting?

Twelve Step programs are not merely self-help groups that help people with compulsive disorders stop doing whatever it is they feel compelled to do (drinking, helping the drinker, etc.). The programs teach people how to live—peacefully, happily, successfully. They bring peace. They promote healing. They give life to their members—frequently a richer, healthier life than those people knew before they developed whatever problem they developed. The Twelve Steps are a way of life.

We are powerless over another person’s drinking and the effects of alcoholism in his or her life. We are powerless over people—what they do, say, think, feel, or don’t do, say, think, or feel. We have been trying to do the impossible. At this point we understand this and make a rational decision to quit trying to do what we cannot ever do, no matter how hard we try. At this point we turn our eyes to ourselves—to the ways we have been affected, to our characteristics, to our pain.

Tag is a fun game for a child. But it’s not a game for people with BPD. Lacking a clear sense of who they are, and feeling empty and inherently defective, people with BPD feel like “it” all the time. Others seem to run away from them, which is lonely and excruciatingly painful. So borderlines cope by trying to “tag” someone else. This is called projection.

The BPs unconscious hope is that by projecting this unpleasant stuff onto another person—by tagging someone else and making them “it”—the person with BPD will feel better about themselves. And they do feel better, for a little while. But the pain comes back. So the game is played again and again.

When someone with BPD tags you, they’re unconsciously trying to transfer their own behaviors, feelings, or perceived traits onto you. When ­projecting their traits onto you, the person with BPD thinks they’re defective, so they accuse you of having something wrong with you.

How can people with BPD deny that they are projecting when it is so obvious to everyone else? The answer is that shame and splitting may combine with projection and denial to make the “Tag, You’re It” defense mechanism a more powerful way of denying ownership of unpleasant thoughts and feelings.

Some people with BPD feel shame—defective at the core of their being. Like everyone else, people with BPD have negative feelings, behaviors, and traits. But because of splitting—black-and-white thinking—they often deny any flaws, because that would make them less than perfect. And if they’re not perfect, they’re worthless. Projection then completes the picture. The BPD logic goes like this: There seems to be a problem. It’s not my fault. Therefore, the problem must be yours.

Some adults who enter into relationships with borderlines feel brainwashed by the BPs accusations and criticisms. Says Benham: “The techniques of brainwashing are simple: isolate the victim, expose them to consistent messages, mix with sleep deprivation, add some form of abuse, get the person to doubt what they know and feel, keep them on their toes, wear them down, and stir well.”

Continual blame and criticism are other defense mechanisms people with BPD who act out use. The criticism may be based on a real issue that the person with BPD has exaggerated, or it may be a pure fantasy on the borderline’s part. Family members we interviewed have been raged at and castigated for such things as carrying a grocery bag the wrong way, having bedsheets that weighed too heavily on the BP’s toes, and reading a book the BP demanded they read. One exasperated non-BP said that if by some chance he didn’t make an unforgivable error one day, his wife would probably rage at him for being too perfect. Another family member asked, “If a non-BP is standing out in the woods making a statement—and their borderline partner isn’t around to hear it—is the non-BP still wrong?”

Non-BPs being devalued by someone with BPD cherish clear and powerful memories of the times when the borderline thought they could do no wrong. Some family members say they feel like the person who loved them has died and that someone they do not know has taken over the BP’s body. One non-BP said, “If I had cancer, at least I would die just once. This emotional abuse ensures that I die many, many times and that I will always live on the edge.”

bargaining This stage is characterized by the non-BP making concessions in order to bring back the “normal” behavior of the person they love. The thinking goes, “If I do what this person wants, I will get what I need in this relationship.” We all make compromises in relationships. But the sacrifices that people make to satisfy the borderlines they care about can be very costly. And the concessions may never be enough.

It is very stressful to be around someone who may berate you at any moment with no visible provocation. In an attempt to gain some control over what appear to be unpredictable BP behaviors, non-BPs often find themselves “on alert.” Being on alert requires a heightened sense of arousal both physically and psychologically that, over time, can wear down the body’s natural defenses against stress, leading to headaches, ulcers, high blood pressure, and other illnesses.

Non-BPs often begin to see things in black and white and see all-or-nothing solutions to problems. Moodiness is also extremely common in non-BPs—they’re often in a good mood when the BP is up and a bad mood when the BP is down.

Many non-BPs assume that by subordinating their own needs for the sake of the BP (or to avoid a fight), they are helping. While the non-BP’s motives are commendable, this actually enables, or reinforces, inappropriate behavior. Borderlines learn that their actions will have few negative consequences; therefore, they have little motivation to change.

It may be obvious to you that the person in your life with BPD needs help. But it may not be obvious to him or her. For people with BPD, admitting that anything about them is less than perfect, let alone acknowledging that they may have a personality disorder, can send them into a spiral of shame and self-doubt.

They need you to let them take care of themselves and to not do things for them that they can do for themselves. The best way to do this and help them is by working on yourself.”

Patricia (BP) For those of you who have decided to stay with your BPD family member, thank you, thank you! We so need your love and support. We need you to believe in us and encourage us in our recovery. But if you stay, seek therapy for yourself if necessary and make sure you don’t lose yourself in the process. You can’t lose your own identity. You must come first. Because if you lose it, then the borderline doesn’t really have a supporter. She just has another person in her life with a lot of problems.

When the destructive bad qualities began to manifest themselves, you got through it by telling yourself that in the end, these good qualities supersede the bad ones. Well, maybe they will or maybe they won’t. Non-BPs aren’t masochists; they’re optimists—which may or may not turn out to be warranted. It is hard to give up on that optimism and let go of a relationship that’s so good otherwise.

When a behavior is intermittently reinforced, extinguishing the behavior takes a lot longer once the reward has been removed. Intermittent reinforcement can work both ways. You are intermittently reinforced when the BP is in a good mood. You can’t predict when it will occur next—but you know it could be soon. The BP can also be intermittently reinforced when you occasionally cave in to his or her demands.

Some non-BPs think they are helpless in their relationship when, in actuality, they are feeling scared. Fear and anxiety are not the same as being helpless. Non-BPs are typically fearful that their efforts toward limit setting and change will be met with rage and anger. Therefore, in an effort to avoid negative reactions of BPs, non-BPs will describe themselves as “helpless.” Moreover, believing you are helpless may also serve the purpose of ridding yourself of any responsibility for making changes or for creating a better life for yourself. You may think that if you’re “helpless” that means you’re a “victim”—a person that others can’t blame for their situation.

Some non-BPs absorb their BP’s projections and soak up their pain and rage (sponging). These non-BPs may be under the illusion that they are helping the BP. But in fact, by not reflecting the BP’s painful feelings back to their rightful owner (mirroring), they are rewarding the BP for using these defense mechanisms.

In these kinds of situations, it’s helpful to remember the developmental levels that you learned in chapter 3. Jessie looks like a young adult. She sounds like a young adult. But emotionally, Jessie is a small, vulnerable child, feeling forsaken by a mother whom she believes doesn’t know or care she exists. But instead of crying for her mommy the way a toddler would, Jessie shouts and threatens. Her childlike feelings bring about very real adult consequences. Such is the nature of BPD. You may make things harder for yourself if you expect adultlike behavior from someone who is currently incapable of it or if you censor your negative feelings and scold yourself for having them.

all of these things will be perceived as abandonment by the person with BPD. That’s why you may need to gently point out that you are not acting against the person; you are acting for yourself. Explain that your limits are essential to the health of the relationship and that you are asking the BP to observe them so you can be with him or her for a very long time.

When I rage at people, they are no longer real people with real feelings. They become the object of my hatred and the cause of my distress. They are the enemy. I get paranoid and believe they want to hurt me, and I am determined to strike out to prove control over them.

Dresser also points out that because some people with BPD do not have the capacity to regulate their emotions, all anger has the same intensity. A mild irritation seems indistinguishable from an impassioned fury. Dresser suggests, “Sometimes it’s important to ask the person with BPD, ‘On a scale of 1 to 10, how mad are you?’”

It is hard for most people to accept that someone they love could do something to hurt them. If love for the BP in your life, or happy memories of the good times you shared, are preventing you from protecting yourself, it’s essential that you understand that the BP may not feel the same way. Splitting may render the BP unable to remember the good feelings he or she had for you or to see you as a whole person with both good and bad qualities. As a result, the BP may view you as an evil monster who deserves to be punished. The sooner you realize this, the better

Mindfulness is awareness without judgment. As mindfulness researcher Jon Kabat-Zinn notes, mindfulness is “the ability to be aware of your thoughts, emotions, physical sensations, and actions—in the present moment—without judging or criticizing yourself or your experience” (2005). Some people call this “being centered”; others call it encountering one’s “true self.”

Even if the principles we rely on are principles of great despair, we would rather be certain than uncertain.  We would rather be sure of a correctly predicted negative outcome than face the realistic uncertainty of an unpredictable future even if it includes the possibility of great joy and success. People buy immeasurable loads of bullshit for the illusion of security.  In individual cases it is called being neurotic. In mass hysteria like that exemplified by the George W.

Mankind emerged from savagery and barbarism under the leadership of selected individuals whose personal prowess, capacity, or wisdom gave them the right to lead and the power to compel obedience. Such leaders have always been a minute fraction of the whole, but as long as the tradition of their predominance persisted they were able to use the brute strength of the unthinking herd as part of their own force, and were able to direct at will the blind dynamic impulse of the slaves, peasants, or lower classes. Such a despot had an enormous power at his disposal which, if he were benevolent or even intelligent, could be used, and most frequently was used, for the general uplift of the race. Even those rulers who most abused this power put down with merciless rigor the antisocial elements, such as pirates, brigands, or anarchists, which impair the progress of a community, as disease or wounds cripple an individual.

To invent new processes, to establish new principles, to elucidate and unravel the laws of nature, calls for genius. To imitate or to adopt what others have invented is not genius but mimicry.

Some idea of the value of these small strains can be gained from the recent statistics which demonstrate that Massachusetts produces more than fifty times as much genius per hundred thousand whites as does Georgia, Alabama, or Mississippi, although apparently the race, religion, and environment, other than climatic conditions, are much the same, except for the numbing presence in the South of a large stationary negro population.

The progress of civilization becomes evident only when immense periods are studied and compared, but the lesson is always the same, namely, that race is everything. Without race there can be nothing except the slave wearing his master's clothes, stealing his master's proud name, adopting his master's tongue, and living in the crumbling ruins of his master's palace.

We Americans must realize that the altruistic ideals which have controlled our social development during the past century, and the maudlin sentimentalism that has made America "an asylum for the oppressed," are sweeping the nation toward a racial abyss. If the Melting Pot is allowed to boil without control, and we continue to follow our national motto and deliberately blind ourselves to all "distinctions of race, creed, or color," the type of native American of Colonial descent will become as extinct as the Athenian of the age of Pericles, and the Viking of the days of Rollo.

People often want to believe God is focused and aware of them. In doing this they minimize how great and vast God actually is. If we believe God is aware and focused on us then we also end up waiting for God to acknowledge us. We wait for God to choose us. You must choose to find your way to God rather than wait for God to find you. Choose to become Aware! You must decide to move into God’s awareness and follow that route.

But civilization meant a change from a "natural" to a more or less artificial, man-made environment, in which natural selection was increasingly modified by "social" selection. And social selection altered survival values all along the line. In the first place, it enabled many weak, stupid, and degenerate persons to live and beget children who would have certainly perished in the state of nature, or even on the savage and barbarian planes.

Absorbed in personal and social matters, racial matters were neglected. Late marriage, fewer children, and celibacy combined to thin the ranks of the successful, diminish the number of superior strains, and thus gradually impoverish the race. Meanwhile, as the numbers of the superior diminished, the numbers of the inferior increased. No longer ruthlessly weeded by natural selection, the inferior survived and multiplied.

These cases have, however, been carefully investigated, and the more they are studied the more convincing grows the evidence that greatnese never arises out of "nothing." Take Abraham Lincoln. He was long a shining example for the environmentalist thesis. Lincoln is popularly supposed to have come from "poor white trash" of a very inferior order. But careful in- vestigation proves that this is emphatically not so.

I venture to ex- press the opinion that a great man has never been pro- duced from parents of subnormal mentality. A great man is more apt to arise if both parents are of very sup- perior ability than if only one parent is above mediocrity. Where the great man appears to stand far above the level of his immediate ancestors it is due in large part, I believe, to the fact that each parent supplied peculiar qualities lacking in the other, assisted also by qualities from more remote ancestors which may have conspired to furnish the necessary complement of hereditary factors

Such are the investigations of biology concerning hu- man inequalities. They are certainly striking, and they all point to the same conclusions, namely: that such inequalities are inborn; that they are predetermined by heredity; and that they are not inherently modified by either environment or opportunity.

A large number of careful investigations made among school children have revealed literally amazing dis- crepancies between their chronological and their mental ages. In classes of first grade grammar-school children, where the chronological age is about six years, some pupils are found with mental ages as low as three while other pupils are found with mental ages as high as nine or ten. Similarly, in first year high-school classes, where the chronological age is about fourteen years, the mental age of some pupils may rank as low as ten or eleven, while the mental age of others may rise as high as nineteen or twenty.

In some ways, selection in the human race has almost ceased; in many ways it is actually re- versed, that is, it results in the survival of the inferior rather than the superior. In the olden days the criminal was summarily executed, the weakly child died soon after birth through lack of proper care and medical at- tention, the insane were dealt with so violently that if they were not killed by the treatment they were at least left hopelessly 'incurable,' and had little chance of be- coming parents. Harsh measures, all of these; but they kept the germ-plasm of the race reasonably purified.

"To-day, how is it? The inefficients, the wastrels, the physical, mental, and moral cripples are carefully preserved at public expense. The criminal is turned out on parole after a few years, to become the father of a family. The insane is discharged as 'cured,' again to take up the duties of citizenship. The feeble-minded child is painfully 'educated,' often at the expense of his normal brother or sister. In short, the undesirables of the race, with whom the bloody hand of natural selection 92 would have made short work early in life, are now nursed along to old age."(1)

feeble-minded persons usually breed rapidly, with no regard for consequences. In former times the numbers of the feeble-minded were kept down by the stern processes of natural selection, but modem charity and philanthropy have protected them and have thus favored their rapid multiplication. The feeble-minded are becoming an increasingly serious problem in every civilized country to-day.

A typical case is that of the "Juke family," which was first investigated in the year 1877, and re-investi- gated in 1915. To quote from the original study: "From one lazy vagabond nicknamed 'Juke,' born in rural New York in 1720, whose two sons married five degen- erate sisters, six generations numbering about 1,200 per- sons of every grade of idleness, viciousness, lewdness, pauperism, disease, idiocy, insanity, and criminality were traced. Of the total seven generations, 300 died in infancy; 310 were professional paupers, kept in alms- houses a total of 2,300 years; 440 were physically wrecked by their own 'diseased wickedness'; more than half the woman fell into prostitution; 130 were convicted criminals; 60 were thieves; 7 were murderers; only 20 learned a trade, 10 of these in state prison, and all at a state cost of over $1,250,000."(1) By the year 1915, the clan had reached its ninth generation, and had greatly lengthened Its evil record. It then numbered 2,820 in- dividuals, half of whom were alive. About the year 1880 the Jukes had left their original home and had scattered widely over the country, but change of environment had made no material change in their natures, for they still showed "the same feeble-mindedness, indolence licentiousness, and dishonesty, even when not handi- capped by the associations of their bad family name and despite the fact of their being surrounded by better social conditions." (2) The cost to the state had now risen to about $2,500,000. As the investigator remarks, all this evil might have been averted by preventing the repro-

The feeble-minded never overturned a state. An essentially negative element, they may drag a civilization down toward sodden degeneracy, but they have not the wit to disrupt it. The insane, on the other hand, are apt to be intensely dynamic and to misuse their powers for de- structive ends. We shall presently see how many apostles of anarchic violence and furious discontent have been persons of ill-balanced mind.

"It is folly to keep up the delusion that more democ- racy and more education will make over these all-born into good citizens. Democracy was never intended for degenerates, and a nation breeding freely of the sort that must continually be repressed is not headed toward an extension of democratic liberties. Rather, it is inevitable that class lines shall harden as a protection against the growing numbers of the underbred, just as in all previous cultures. However remote a cataclysm may be, our present racial trend is toward social chaos or a dictator- ship.

"Meanwhile, we invite social turmoil by advancing muddled notions of equality. Democracy, as we loosely idealize it nowadays, is an overdrawn picture of earthly bliss; it stirs the little-brained to hope for an impossible levelling of human beings. The most we can honestly expect to achieve is a fair levelling of opportunity; but every step toward that end brings out more distinctly those basic inequalities of inheritance which no environ- mental effort can improve. So discontent is loudest in those least capable of grasping opportunity when it is offered."

We gradually observe a 105 general loosening of morality, a disappearance of logic from thought and action, a morbid irritability and vacil- lation of public opinion, a relaxation of character. Offenses are treated with a frivolous or sentimental in- dulgence which encourages rascals of all kinds. People lose the power of moral indignation, and accustom them- selves to despise it as something banal, unadvanced, inelegant, and unintelligent. Deeds that would formerly have disqualified a man forever from public life are no longer an obstacle in his career, so that suspicious and tainted personalities make it possible to rise to respon- sible positions, sometimes to the control of national busi- ness. Sound common sense becomes more rarely and less worthily appreciated, more and more meanly rated. Nobody is shocked by the most absurd proposals, mea- sures and fashions, and folly rules in legislation, adminis- tration, domestic and foreign politics. Every demagogue finds a following, every fool collects adherents, every event makes an impression beyond all measure, kindles ridiculous enthusiasm, spreads morbid consternation, leads to violent manifestations in one sense or the other and to official proceedings that are at least useless, often deplorable and dangerous. Everybody harps upon his 'rights' and rebels against every limitation of his arbi- trary desires by law or custom. Everybody tries to escape from the compulsion of discipline and to shake off the burden of duty."

Against these assaults of inferiority; against the cleverly led legions of the de- generate and the backward; where can civilization look for its champions? Where but in the slender ranks of the racially superior -- those "A" and "B" stocks which, in America for example, we know to-day constitute barely 13 1/2 per cent of the population? It is this "thin red line" of rich, untainted blood which stands between us and barbarism or chaos. Them alone lies our hope. Let us not deceive ourselves by prating about government," "education," "democracy": our laws, our constitutions, our very sacred books, are in the last analysis mere paper barriers, which will hold only so long as there stand be- hind them men and women with the intelligence to under stand and the character to maintain them.

The gesture of a man opening a door for a woman illustrates how men and women should relate. We all know a woman can open a door herself. But when a man does it, he is affirming her femininity, beauty and charm. When she accepts this gesture, she is validating his masculine power. This trade, a woman surrendering physical power in exchange for a man's protection (i.e. love) is the essence of heterosexuality. In order to develop emotionally, men and women need this mutual validation as much as they need sex itself. Sex is an expression of it.

It is not uncommon for people to be unaware of what they have said or done to set off a borderline personality. A seemingly neutral conversation can go awry in a split second. The reactions of borderline personalities often seem to come out of left field and can feel very exaggerated. The thing is, their reactions and emotions are very genuine and real to them. You may find the situation absurd, but from their perspective the feelings are perfectly justified.

The boss and the employee are not on the same page and instead are having two parallel conversations: The employee is trying to communicate that she has been hurt, while the boss is trying to logically respond to what the employee is saying. A conversation with a borderline personality who is upset can feel like playing the “whack a mole” game at a county fair: As you strike the head of a mole with your mallet, another mole quickly pops up some place else. The more mole heads you hit the faster they pop up. During a conversation with a borderline personality the target is constantly moving. You can end up feeling helpless as your attempts to fix the problem fail and seem to worsen the situation.

Being in a relationship with a borderline personality is difficult because of the lack of predictability. It is hard to avoid causing a problem, and at times it can feel like walking in a field of landmines. Logic and reason (which are the strategies most people try first when in a difficult conversation) are useless strategies when conversations are highly emotionally charged, and the topic of conversation makes dramatic, unpredictable shifts. Before you know it, a conversation that would have normally ended with “I didn’t mean anything by it,” turns into knock-down-drag-out and you are left asking yourself, “What just happened?”

Borderline personalities tend to have intense emotional reactions and it usually takes them a long time to calm down. Being confronted by an upset borderline personality is uncomfortable and overwhelming for most people, so the natural tendency is to make the upset stop as quickly as possible. With other people, a simple apology is enough to make them feel better, a bit of clarification is enough to clear up a misunderstanding, a hug or pat on the back or is enough to show sympathy, etc. It is far more difficult to soothe or help borderline personalities deal with their emotions and it takes them a long time to get over them. You may ask yourself, “Aren’t we over this yet?”

Even months or years after an upsetting event has passed, borderline personalities can continue to ruminate about upsetting events. It is not uncommon for people to hold grudges or harbor some feelings of resentment, particularly when they have been extremely hurt by someone. However, borderline personalities can perseverate on very small, or even what they perceive is an injustice. What may be a minor upset to most may devastate a borderline personality.

Hold on Tight! After you and the borderline personality have weathered the storm, you can relax, but only for a moment. Sooner or later the borderline personality will experience another crisis. This can play out several ways. First, he or she can become upset again by the same or similar issue, which you thought had already been resolved. This can be crazing-making (make you feel like you are losing your mind and question yourself) and confusing even if you are not on the receiving end of the emotional upset.

Borderline personalities are highly sensitive, and therefore they are likely to easily be set off by another trigger. Because of this, their relationships are in constant turmoil. You can find some comfort in knowing that it is not just you—sooner or later they will have difficulty with almost everyone whom they encounter. Whether you are directly or indirectly involved in the crisis of the moment, hang on tight. If you are in a relationship with a borderline personality you will ride the emotional roller coaster with him or her.

The extreme ups and downs in the life of borderline personalities makes being in relationships with them difficult. It is not only exhausting for you, but it is exhausting for the borderline personality as well. Most people work to minimize conflict or “drama” in their lives. But when you are involved with a borderline personality the roller coaster cannot be avoided. Many people try to walk on egg shells, which is not fair to them and does not always work because as previously mentioned—the triggers that upset these individuals are not always obvious. Also, experiencing the wrath of a borderline personality is hard on many people. Many people say and do things that they regret when they are feeling extremely angry. But because borderline personalities experience very intense emotions, including anger, quite often, if you are in a relationship with one of these individuals you are at risk of being emotionally beat up more often. Comments such as, “You’re an unsupportive boss!” “You don’t care about me!” “You’re bad partner!”—or more X-rated versions of these—can eventually take a toll on even the strongest person.

The responses of a borderline personality may seem out of proportion to the trigger (e.g., complaint to the regional manager for saying “good” instead of “excellent”), but will seem perfectly appropriate and justified to him or her. A seemingly minor injustice can send a borderline personality on a crusade to punish or correct the perpetrator or prevent future harm. Borderlines constantly create a lot of drama, usually in all facets of their lives. There are soap operas at work, at home, with “friends”, with neighbors, and with relatives.

Borderline personalities lack a normal sense of self. In other words, when they look inside themselves, so to speak, they have difficulty knowing what they think, feel, want, and need. Because of this, they look to cues from others to identify these things. For instance, when faced with a decision of whether or not vote in favor or against something, someone who lacked a strong sense of self would wait to hear how everyone else had voted before casting his or vote. Borderline personalities often go along with the wishes of people with whom they are in relationships.

Borderlines have difficulty drawing that line for themselves. Therefore, borderlines are vulnerable to being taken advantage of by family members, employers, intimate partners, and other people who do not have their best interest in mind. On the other hand, they will violate the boundaries of others and take advantage of people in their lives.

Just as the woman is the heart of the family, the man is the head and shoulders. A feminine woman is her husband's partner. They make decisions together but he has the last word. Men must be the visionaries, the navigators, and the captains. A woman's most important decision is the man she chooses to love (i.e. trust).

Modern men see women as 'castrating, vengeful, power-hungry and obsessed by men's sexual performance,'" a recent study by the French Edition of Elle Magazine concluded. The study based on four 12-man focus groups found that Frenchmen believe that women are out-of-control. They feel belittled by the constant overvaluation of women and dazed by demands to adopt feminine traits yet somehow remain virile. The 25-35 age group felt that women "consume men and abuse them sexually." The magazine characterized this age group as "subjugated and feminized."

It's time for men to be men again. It's time to serve notice to women that if they want a relationship with a man, if they want a family, then they must learn to obey their husbands. Otherwise, they are welcome to be roommates with "liberated men" or become lesbians. The essential difference between masculine and feminine can be put in a nutshell: woman exchanges her power for a man's love. This is what makes her feminine.

Here the wife criticizes and nags. "I can't be myself," the husband says. "I'm walking on eggshells all the time." The wife is emasculating her husband. He compensates by riding a Harley and volunteering at the local fire department. The therapist suggests that the wife stop nagging and the husband listen. She doesn't notice that the husband responds only after the wife starts to cry. Men respond to vulnerability in a woman not power.

most female impersonators today (i.e. feminists) are anatomically women. By encouraging young women to be "strong and independent", feminism has outfitted them with a mental phallus. They have become men and made men redundant. Then they try to coerce men to love them as if men were their hand puppets.

Women's romantic attachments are "mirror images" of how they related to their fathers as girls. They often instinctively repeat what they experienced in childhood, even if it was bad. It's what they know. They are trying to have one more shot at childhood, one more chance to rectify their emotional histories.

Secunda says women whose fathers were emotionally or physically absent during childhood often have trouble achieving orgasm. (31) Understandably, a woman needs to trust in order to "let go." Women with absent fathers feel rootless and aren't sure they belong anywhere. They close up emotionally and tend to have rocky relationships. "Most of these daughters tend to test the men in their lives by starting fights, finding flaws, expecting to be abandoned, or looking for excuses to walk out themselves."

Another pattern is anxiety about supporting themselves or of being financially dependent on men. This is where feminism comes in. "It seems that the less masculine attention they got in childhood, the more they seem to identify with and imitate men, keeping their feelings hidden, preferring casual teasing and unemotional banter to the intimacies of feminine soul bearing." (212) Denied their fathers, women become more masculine. This is a way of bringing daddy back. They become the thing they are missing. (212) In other words, a good father affirms his daughter's innate femininity by telling her how beautiful and smart she is. But if he is absent, she compensates by becoming masculine. This of course undermines her future relationships with men.

The obsessive-compulsive personality is rigid and stubborn. They will only do things the “right” way, and they feel they are the only ones who know what the “right” way is most of the time. This goes beyond the “right” way to vacuum. Even their thoughts about society, people, morals, ethics, politics, work, etc. are so rigid that they will never be persuaded to change their point of view.

Their perfectionism at work means that they will not finish projects or get them in late. They stay later than everyone else and get in earlier than everyone else. This can make you feel lazy, perhaps as if you are not working hard enough. Obsessive-compulsive personalities also treat people differently based on rank. They can be self-righteous and arrogant around people who are equal or subordinate to them in position, but will treat superiors exceptionally well, with lots of graciousness and flattery.

Paranoid personalities are also chronically preoccupied with the fidelity of their spouse or sexual partner. They are extremely jealous and may gather circumstantial evidence to prove their jealous beliefs. This stems from the paranoid personality’s need to be in complete control of their intimate relationships. They want to know where their partner is, what they are doing, and who they are with at all times. Otherwise their paranoia convinces them that something is seriously amiss.

If the paranoid personality is someone you love, you may feel very hurt by their behavior and accusations. Paranoid personalities can interpret almost any remark as a slight against them. And no amount of reassurance or rephrasing will help the paranoid personality not take offense at your harmless comments. If they feel you have crossed them, watch out. Paranoid personalities can bite back. Normally, the mood of the paranoid personality is unhappy, irritated, and edgy. When crossed, this personality can become enraged and aggressive. They may become verbally or physically aggressive as well. In intimate relationships, paranoid personalities are chronically suspicious about their partner’s fidelity. This can turn into a jealous rage, and perhaps even domestic violence. Remember: It is rare for someone to have just one personality disorder. Individuals with PPD may also display traits of Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD) that can be associated with aggression.

Paranoid personalities sometimes tend to believe they are smarter than others because they pick up on “hidden” slights others don’t see. Priding themselves on their rationality, they come across as arrogant and extremely private. Paranoid personalities will not disclose their feelings easily because they believe people who do so are reckless. They are also paranoid that what they say will be used against them. Of course, this does not bode well for an intimate relationship.

THE BIGGEST MISTAKE MEN MAKE Men can have successful marriages with younger mates as long as they behave like men. The biggest mistake men make is to sacrifice their power for love. Most women will test a man to see what he will do for sex. They will see how much abuse he will take, then try to control him. A woman cannot love a man she cannot respect. She cannot respect a man who does not respect himself. Paradoxically the way to win a woman's love is not to take any crap. Ignore the cold shoulder.

So in order for the person with the personality disorder to change their behavior they must 1) admit that their way of thinking and interpreting the world has been faulty for a great portion of their life and 2) be willing to change these destructive behaviors and accept new behaviors in their place. To address personality disorders, the person must be willing to learn to be a new person. As you can imagine, very few people diagnosed with a personality disorder are willing to take the first step of admitting that their interpretation of the world is abnormal. And can you really blame them? What would your response be if someone walked up to you and told you that your entire perception of what is reality is just a manifestation of your mind?

Drop The Mentality Of A Victim: Ozzies will fall into a pattern of feeling sorry for themselves and adopt the identity of a victim. And yes, due to the emotional, verbal, and sometimes physical abuse that we sustain, every single one of us can justifiably claim that we are victims. However, keeping this mentality only keeps us trapped in Oz because with being a victim comes being powerless and a lack of control. This is exactly the response that the person with BPD wants us to display as a means of keeping us off balance.

we want to feel needed and important, and what better way then to go out of our way to make the person we love happy. The problem with this belief is that it is unhealthy for us to constantly be willing to give and drain ourselves emotionally, without ever demanding that our partner return anything into our emotional gas tank. Eventually we begin to feel taken advantage of and build resentment. Plus many of the demands that the BPD makes are so unrealistic or difficult to accomplish that we set ourselves up to fail in both, ours and the BPD’s eyes.

In your relationship, with a person with BPD, it is likely you were subjected to severe emotional abuse. The tactics that a BPD uses to break your spirit and self-esteem parallels the same tactics and manipulations that a violent physical abuser utilizes to keep their victim from leaving. See if these sound familiar: Isolation, Enforcing Trivia Demands, Depravation (sleep, food, things you need to function clearly), Threats, Occasional Indulgences (Hoovering), and Degradation & Criticism.

There’s a big difference between enmeshment and intimacy. Enmeshment may feel like intimacy, but it is not. Intimacy comes from knowing each other very well, accepting shortcomings and differences, and loving each other anyway. Enmeshment is attempting to feel and think as if you were the same person. Since quite a bit of one’s uniqueness is missed this way, neither person can really be known, a very different experience from intimacy.

If sexual intimacy is not grounded in emotional closeness and effective communication, it can lead to problems in the relationship.

obvious that the aliens did exist and that they were working on an agenda that involved an intense study of the human mind, specifically human emotions focusing on erotic bonding and romance relationships.

Apparently the aliens were also experimenting with human emotions, with love and romance relationships, with male-female bonding dramas, with bisexuality and even erotic ideations of all kinds. But the one common denominator that draws the string around all of these cases is an undeniable pattern of obsession and unrequited love.

Alien directed bonding dramas and sexual variations almost always create an undercurrent of obsessive behavior, leading to painful loss and emotional emptiness.

I realized that a subset of abductees from all parts of the world were claiming that alien orchestrated love obsessions were tearing their families apart. I repeat, the aliens seem to calculate exact strategies for specific love matches, with each bonding-drama engineered to create the perfect conditions for their benefit. It is as if the aliens have found our true Achilles Heel — most human beings are incurable romantics.

No matter how often you get those middle-of-the-night SOS calls, no matter how many times you’ve found yourself under attack in the middle of what seemed like a civil conversation, every time it happens you’re likely to be thrown off balance. Extremely dysregulated behavior has a way of blindsiding you.
